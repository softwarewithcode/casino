Tech:<br>
  Backend: IntelliJ (2023.2.2), Eclipse (2023-09 (4.29.0)), Maven IDE integrated, Java21 [https://jdk.java.net/21/], TomEE 9.1.1 plume,<br><br>
  Frontend: Visual Studio Code, Vue, Pinia, HTML canvas, TypeScript, Npm v10.2.1, Node v20.9.0<br><br>

Development and running the files:<br>

IntelliJ (2023.2.2)
1.0 File -> New -> Project from Version Control -> checkout corresponding branch
1.1 Right click casino project's pom.xml -> Add as Maven project -> Reload project and dependencies

Eclipse (2023-09 (4.29.0))
2.0. Download repository. Checkout corresponding branch. Import projects in Eclipse as Maven projects.<br>
     Mouse right click on projects and Maven -> update <br>
2.1 Create new Server with Apache Tomcat v10.0 server adapter. <br> Select JRE as jdk-21.<br>
2.2 Ship the projects into the server and then check startup logs for errors.
1.4. Precompiled UI version should now open from http://localhost:8080/casino/

2. Frontend development: <br>
2.1 In Visual Studio Code -> open frontend folder where package.json exists, <br>
run "npm i" -> loads the dependencies defined in package.json<br>
run "npm run dev" -> starts the UI development server at port 5000. Package.json has predefined port 5000.<br>
open http://localhost:5000 <br>

Restart backend server when tables run out or create more default tables. Restart should take only few seconds.

JUnit tests contains timings for different phases and wait times. <br> There could be some issues with different machines. <br>
 GitHub site contains "Actions" tab where CI tools show 4 different builds for each commit. <br>
 Running all tests takes time thus projects have separate builds to get the result faster.
