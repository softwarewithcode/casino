### Frontend
Current frontends are merely a reference implementations for backend testing. Repo description contains a link which shows how the UI works without building a workspace. <br>
Frontend is reactive using Pinia and Vue combination. Frontend has no animations. <br>
Documentation section has more information about ui-backend websocket communications. It might be useful if you want to test/study WebSockets using this project. Or maybe build brand new user interface. 

### Backend
Java 19 with Virtual Threads preview / JakartaEE.  <br>
Some JUnit tests require additional configuration for using the preview features (from tests run logs).

### For learning
On the backend side it would be really nice to hear if you find/see some bugs especially concurrency related but all are welcomed.
